This sample is packed with 
enigma https://enigmaprotector.com/
and uses 
Autocamo https://autoitscript.com/forum/topic/127186-autocamo-9716b/

1. To get around enigma start DecompileME.exe and dump it while it's running.
You may use Process Hacker( https://processhacker.sourceforge.io/ )/Process detail/Tab_memory ... save to do so.

2. Load the dumped DecompileME.exe_0x401000-0xbc000.bin into MATE. 
   Click more Options/GetCamo's to get the correct vectors that Autocamo modified.
   Now when these are set.
   
3. Load DecompileME.exe into MATE. Decompiling should start now.

4. You may improve the sources by stripping out includes using MATE F12-function renamer.
   The script was compiled with autoit-v3.3.8.1 so get it and point function renamer to its includes dir.
   Well you may also use includes of the currently installed autoit (probably a newer version) 
   or even do that process completely manually since this script is not very big.
